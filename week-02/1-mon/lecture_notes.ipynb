    "\n",
    "- SQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS).\n",
    "    - Relations created via Primary/Foreign keys\n",
    "    - Save space by using multiple tables\n",
    "- SQL databases are used to store **structured** data (relational data).\n",
    "- Use queries to get only the necessary data (unlike many apis!)\n",
    "- can caluclate summary statistics on groups subsets of data\n",
    "- mentioned in most data science job postings\n",
    "    - As a data scientist, focus on data retrieval, not definition, manipulation, control\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges with SQL\n",
    "- SQL is a declarative language (unlike python, which is imperative)\n",
    "    -  order of operations\n",
    "- Long, nested queries with many variable names\n",
    "    - vs. imperative programming where good programs break logic up into multiple steps\n",
    "- Many things happening concurrently in a single SQL statement, order not explicit\n",
    "    - vs imperatve programming where code executes line-by-line\n",
    "- Debugging is more difficult thanks to the above =(\n",
    "    - can help to break down a complex query into steps and test them incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
